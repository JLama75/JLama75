ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jyoti Lama
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in utilizing new bioinformatic tools and models for visualizing and analyzing genomic data
- ðŸŒ± I mainly work with R, Python, and bash scripts
- âš¡ During my PhD I worked with small and total RNA-seq as well as genomic datasets to determine the causative variants associated with host tolerance to Transposable elements in Drosophila
- ðŸ”­ In my postdoc I analyzed GRO/PRO/ChRO-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq datasets to understand transcriptional regulation in prophase I of mouse spermatogenesis
